Welcome to the XMPP Newsletter, great to have you here again! This issue covers the month of May 2022.

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

By the way, xmpp.org features [a new page about XMPP RFCs](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   [Pubsub Public Subscriptions](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/pubsub-public-subscriptions.html)
    -   This specification provides a way to make subscriptions to a node public
-   [Ephemeral Messages](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/ephemeral-messages-v2.html)
    -   This specification encourages a shift in privacy settings wrt. logging policies.

### New

-   No new XEPs this month.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 0.4 of [XEP-0356](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0356.html) (Privileged Entity)
    -   Add "iq" privilege (necessary to implement XEPs such as ).
    -   Roster pushes are now transmitted to privileged entity with "roster" permission of "get" or "both". This can be disabled.
    -   Reformulate to specify than only initial stanza and "unavailable" stanzas are transmitted with "presence" pemission.
    -   Namespace bump. (jp)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

-   No Last Call this month.

### Stable

-   No XEPs advanced to Stable this month.

### Deprecated

-   No XEP deprecated this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.
